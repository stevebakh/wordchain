# Wordchain

Scala implementation the well known word game known as ['Word Ladder' or 'Doublets'](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word_ladder).

> The player is given a start word and an end word. In order to win the game, the player must change the start word into the end word progressively, creating an existing word at each step. Each step consists of a single letter substitution.

The code implements a simple breadth first search to determine the shortest path between the two words.
